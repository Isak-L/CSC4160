 # IMPORTANT NOTE！！
 
 The folder "cloud" is the whole Django project. 
 
 Currently, it only have the project skeleton. But models and database is ready. 
 You can make modifications and improvements base on the skeleton. 
 
 NOTICE that you might need to download "SQLite3" database since I use this database for the project.
